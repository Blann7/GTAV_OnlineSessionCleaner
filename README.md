An empty session in GTA Online helps you complete tasks without interference from other players. The program is based on the emulation of pausing and resuming the GTAV process, no ban.

The program is not injected into the game in any way, it works independently of it.

1) Launch the game.
2) Launch the application.
3) Press the Clean button and wait (7-10 seconds)
4) Session cleared.
5) You can close the program.
